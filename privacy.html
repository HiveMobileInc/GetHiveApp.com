		<h1>Privacy Policty</h1>
			<p>This Privacy Policy (this “<strong>Policy</strong>”) describes how Hive Mobile Inc. and its subsidiaries (Nu Messenger) with authorized links to this Policy, (collectively, “<strong>Hive Mobile</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) collect, store, use and disclose Personal Information (defined below) from individuals (a) who use any of the websites located at <a href="http://numessenger.com">www.numessenger.com</a>, the Hive Optimized Pages (defined below) provided by us and/or all other websites of Hive Mobile with authorized links to this Policy (the “<strong>Sites</strong>”), (b) who use our products or services with authorized links to this Policy, including but not limited to our Hive Messenger product, products or services provided by us that you purchase and use within our Hive Messenger product, the Hive share button, and the Apps that Hive (defined below) provided by us (the “<strong>Products</strong>”), or (c) otherwise. It does not apply to corporate or business information or employee information.</p>
<p><strong>We at Hive Mobile are committed to protecting your privacy. By using our Sites and/or Products, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<h5 class="anchor">1. General</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p><strong>1.1 Personal Information</strong> is information about an identifiable individual such as your name, address, telephone number and email address.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Children.</strong> We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about anyone under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Jurisdiction of Processing.</strong> Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States and/or Canada, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
<h5 class="anchor">2. Collection of Information</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Accounts.</strong> For some of our Products or Sites, we may require you to create an account with us. We will ask you to provide your first and last name, birth date, email address, and (optional) phone number and to choose a username and password when you register for an account on Hive. After downloading one of our Products or accessing one of our Sites, you may also be asked to verify your account via email. We will retain your phone number in hashed format only. From time to time, we may request that you provide us with certain demographic information including but not limited to gender and age information.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Products and Sites.</strong></p>
<p>(a) <em>Suggested Friends Features</em>. Hive Messenger includes an “address book matching feature” and/or a “you may know” feature and/or a “find friends” feature (collectively, the “<strong>Suggested Friends Features</strong>”), which use your address book contacts to help you connect with your friends by making suggestions to you and your friends. The Suggested Friends Features are optional. When you sign up with Hive Messenger for the first time and whenever you log into your Hive account, you will be prompted to indicate whether you want to use the Suggested Friends Features. If you elect to use the Suggested Friends Features, Hive Messenger will periodically access and upload the phone numbers and email addresses (but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> names) from your mobile device address book to Hive’s servers, and check if those phone numbers and email addresses are registered to a Hive user. If a phone number and/or email address in your address book is registered to a Hive user, Hive will inform you of the Hive user’s first and last name (as registered on Hive) and Hive username, after which you can add them to your Hive contacts by sending them a Hive message. Emails and phone numbers are not shared in this process. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consent from your address book contacts that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the phone numbers and email addresses as described above for the purpose of generating friend suggestions. If you opt out of the Suggested Friends Features, Hive will promptly delete your address book information from its databases and Hive will not use your phone number and email address to provide the Suggested Friends Features for other users who may have your contact information in their address book. Hive will use industry standard practices to securely transmit all data used in the Suggested Friends Features. NOTE: If you opt out of the “you may know”, on older versions of Hive Messenger you may still use the “find friends” feature, but Hive will not retain your address book for the “you may know” feature. If you elect to use the Suggested Friends Features, Hive Messenger will periodically rescan your address book contacts to check for new friends who have joined Hive Messenger and present you with people that you may know (as described in Section 2.2(a)), after which you can add them to your Hive contacts by sending them a Hive message.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Profile Picture</em>. Hive Messenger includes a profile picture feature that allows you to optionally add a profile picture to your account. If you upload a profile picture, it will be associated with your Hive username. If you do not upload a profile picture, no photo will be associated with your Hive username. Your profile picture will be available in your public profile and to anyone you send a message to or receive a message from.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Public Profile</em>. When you create an account with Hive, Hive will automatically create a public profile page for you. Your public profile will display your first name, last name, Hive username, and profile picture (if you have uploaded one) (your “<strong>User Profile</strong>”).</p>
<p>(d) <em>Messages</em>. Hive Messenger permits users to send messages between users. If you send a message to one or more other user(s), we will retain the message sender and recipient data (but not the text of the message) and associate it with your Hive username. If you “Share” content (including Hive Optimized Pages or content via the Hive share button posted on any web site) with another user using the applicable Hive Messenger interface, Hive may retain the domain and subdomain information for web sites that are shared. Subject to Section 7, we will delete the message promptly after the message has been delivered to the intended recipient(s). If the message is not delivered, we may retain it on our system.</p>
<p>(e) <em>Other Content</em>. In addition to plain-text messages, Hive Messenger may be used to send certain other content between users, such as pictures from your smart phone. If you send such content to one or more other user(s), we may retain that content on your behalf and associate it with your Hive username. Unlike messages, content may be stored in our systems for some period of time before being deleted (subject to Section 7).</p>
<p>(f) <em>Hive Optimized Pages</em>. Mobile app developers use tools that Hive makes available to developers, including our application program interface (“<strong>API</strong>”) and Hive share button, to create Hive optimized mobile web pages ("<strong>Hive Optimized Pages</strong>") and other experiences that work within Hive Messenger. Hive Optimized Pages (referred to as “Card Features” in earlier versions of this Policy) may be offered by us or by third parties. Among other features, Hive Optimized Pages may enable users to send links to information or other content (“<strong>Hive Optimized Page Content</strong>”) to other users through Hive Messenger. For example, Sketch is a Hive Optimized Page which enables users to send links to sketches (the Content) to other users. When a user receives and opens the link to Hive Optimized Page Content from another Hive user, that link or content web addresses will be automatically added to the user’s browsing history list within Hive Messenger. You may remove links or addresses to Hive Optimized Page Content from your browsing history list within Hive Messenger by following the instructions on Hive Messenger. If you post Hive Optimized Page Content to a Hive Optimized Page, or send a link to such content to one or more other Hive user(s), we may retain the Hive Optimized Page Content on your behalf and associate it with your Hive username. Unlike messages, Hive Optimized Page Content may be stored in our systems for some period of time before being deleted (subject to Section 7). If a Hive Optimized Page asks you for your permission to access your user information, and you agree, the person or entity providing the web page will have access to your User Profile in the process of providing the Hive Optimized Page or Hive Optimized Page Content. Please see Section 2.2(h) for more information about Hive Optimized Pages provided by third parties.</p>
<p>(g) <em>Apps that Hive</em>. Hive Messenger integrates with certain applications that users may separately download (“<strong>Apps that Hive</strong>”) and permits users who have installed such applications to send the application’s content (“<strong>Apps that Hive Content</strong>”) to other users who have installed such applications through Hive Messenger. For the avoidance of doubt, you must separately download Apps that Hive in order to use such applications with Hive Messenger. Apps that Hive may be provided by Hive or third parties. If you download an App provided by a third party, your name, Hive username, profile photo and message identifier information may be disclosed to the third party. If you send Apps that Hive Content to one or more other user(s), we may retain that Apps that Hive Content on your behalf (e.g., it may show up in your Apps that Hive history) and associate it with your Hive username. Unlike messages, Apps that Hive Content may be stored in our systems for some period of time before being deleted (subject to Section 7). Please see Section 2.2(h) for more information about Apps that Hive provided by third parties.</p>
<p>(h) <em>Third Party Sites and Products</em>. As mentioned above, certain Hive Optimized Pages and Apps that Hive are provided by third parties (“<strong>Third Party Sites and Products</strong>”). Hive Mobile is not responsible for and does not control such Third Party Sites and Products. Hive Mobile has no obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve, endorse, or make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Sites and Products. You use all Third Party Sites and Products at your own risk. When you access a Third Party Site and Product, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any Third Party Sites and Products. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Third Party Sites and Products may have access to your username, User Profile, the username of the intended recipient(s), and the content that you send using the Third Party Site and Product.</p>
<p>(i) <em>Groups</em>. Hive Messenger allows you to send messages, other content, Hive Optimized Page Content, and Apps that Hive Content to more than one user, by simply adding the user to your Hive Messenger conversation. Once a user is added to a conversation, such user will receive all subsequent messages, other content, Hive Optimized Page Content, and Apps that Hive Content sent as part of that conversation.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Other Information You Provide.</strong> We may also collect Personal Information from time to time through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If/when you add a favorite within the Hive Messenger application.</li>
<li>If/when you contact us via email (with feedback, for support, or otherwise), we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</li>
<li>If/when you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.</li>

<p><strong>2.4 Information Collected Via Technology.</strong> We or our third party service providers collect information about you, your computer, and/or your mobile device automatically through various technologies as described below (“<strong>Collection Technologies</strong>”) and such information may be associated with your Hive username, your phone and/or your IP address. Such information may include: what Products you downloaded and Sites you accessed; pages or Third Party Sites and Products you viewed or used; time spent on pages; terms searched; links clicked; how long it takes for pages to load; what type of device you have; language preference; device uptime and network status; a generated device id internal to Hive Messenger; if you have an iPhone or a Windows Phone, your push tokens; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the connection for each authentication request; the date/time stamp for various Hive Messenger activities; the use of Hive Optimized Pages and the sharing of content through the Products; and other similar diagnostic logs. We may also collect information on an anonymous basis regarding how you use various Hive Messenger features. We may also use Cookies, beacons, image tags and similar technologies to gather information about you, such as your computer’s or mobile device’s location, brand of mobile device, etc. “<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Sites may not work properly. This type of information is collected in part to make the Sites and the Products more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. Like most companies, we automatically gather the information described above and store it in log files each time you visit our Sites or use our Products. When you use the web browser feature provided through the Hive Messenger, third party websites may also collect information from you using Collection Technologies, but this Policy does not cover such collection or any resulting use or disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Hive Messenger Search Engine Feature.</strong> Along with other information collected via the Collection Technologies, when you use a search engine feature of Hive Messenger, Hive may collect search queries submitted through the Hive Messenger search engine and retain them in anonymous form.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Hive Messenger Web Browser Feature.</strong> Along with the other information collected via the Collection Technologies, when you use the web browser feature of Hive Messenger to visit web pages, Hive may collect the web addresses of the sites you visit (i.e. your browsing history).</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Hive Share Button.</strong> Along with the other information collected via the Collection Technologies, when you use the Hive share button hosted on third party websites to transmit links or other content to other Hive users, Hive may collect the web addresses and content that you elect to send using the share button. We may also collect information about how many times you use the Hive share button and from where.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 Crash Analytics.</strong> We may analyze errors or malfunctions in the Hive Messenger application for the purpose of providing Sites and Products, resolving bugs and improving performance. This analysis may result in limited log information (which may include some browsing data and small amounts of personally identifiable information) being collected by us.</p>
<p><strong>2.9 Information Collected from You About Others.</strong> If you decide to invite a third party to create an account with us, you should only do so if you think that third party would want to be contacted by us. If you extend an invitation, we will collect your and the third party’s names and email addresses in order to send an email and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consent from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to collect the third party’s name and email address as described above. You or the third party may contact us at support@gethiveapp.com to request removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>2.10 Information Collected from Third Party Companies.</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Sites and our Products, for a variety of purposes, including to verify other information about you and to improve the Products we provide. We may use anonymous information to enhance the advertising we provide to you.</p>
<p><strong>2.11 Information Transmitted to Social Networking Sites.</strong> Some of our Products will enable you to post content to social networking sites (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to do this, we will provide your information to such social networking sites in accordance with your elections. Such site’s use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your use of those sites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such social networking sites. Hive Mobile will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such sites; (ii) the content, products, or services on or availability of such sites; or (iii) your use of any such third party social networking sites.</p>
<p><strong>2.12 Advertising and Analytics Partners and Tracking Choices.</strong> We may share anonymous data with advertising networks, analytics providers (including Google Analytics), and other third parties (“<strong>Advertising Partners</strong>”) to analyze Site and Product usage by our users and develop and deliver targeted advertising and promotional content in our Sites and Products and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow our Advertising Partners to collect this type of information within our Sites and Products, and they may share such information, as well as other information they collect through other third party websites, products and services, with us and third parties. Our Advertising Partners may collect this information through the use of their Collection Technologies (e.g., their cookies or beacons), or by requesting this information directly from you (e.g. via Promoted Chats). The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery, and send you promotional messages, to personalize your user experience by increasing the probability that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake analytics (i.e., to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). We do not control our Advertising Partners or their Collection Technologies or privacy practices, and this Policy does not govern their use of information collected from you using their Collection Technologies or Promoted Chats.

<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> Generally, we collect, store, use and disclose information to enable us to provide the Sites and our Products, create your account (if required), identify you as a user, provide the right Hive experience for your age, respond to your inquiries and emails, analyze and improve the Sites and our Products, send you administrative and service related communications, send you newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials or advertising appropriate to your age, and for other advertising purposes as described in Section 2.12.</p>

<p><strong>3.3</strong> We may create anonymous information from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

We may additionally use your anonymous information for the advertising purposes described in Section 2.12. Hive reserves the right to use and disclose anonymous information for any purpose and to any third party in its sole discretion.</p>
<h5 class="anchor">4. Disclosures &amp; Transfers</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p>In addition to the disclosures described in Section 2, we may additionally disclose your information as follows:</p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> Our servers and our service providers may be located in the United States, Canada or other countries and, as such, your Personal Information may be available to the U.S., Canadian or other government or its agencies under a lawful order made in the applicable country (and such information may be further made available by that country to other countries), irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> From time to time we may employ third parties to help operate our business, the Sites or our Products. Examples of such service providers include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services and/or content for analyzing data, including user content, research services, advertising and marketing assistance, payment processing (including credit card payments), and customer service. Access to your Personal Information by each of these service providers is limited to the information reasonably necessary to perform its limited function and these service providers may only use your Personal Information to provide services on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong> If you download an App that Hives or access or use a Hive Optimized Page provided by a third party, your User Profile and message identifier information may be disclosed to the third party. We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in a separate consent for a new product or service.</p>
<p><strong>4.4</strong> If you decide to invite another user of Hive Messenger to use or access a Hive Optimized Page, you should only do so if you have the consent of that user to allow his or her Hive username and profile information (last name, first name, profile photo) to be shared with the provider of the Hive Optimized Page for the purposes disclosed in the privacy policy applicable to the Hive Optimized Page. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consent from the users that you invite that may be required by law to allow for this collection, use and disclosure of this information. If another user of Hive Messenger invites you to use a Hive Optimized Page, you consent to us sharing your User Profile with the provider of the Hive Optimized Page.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong> We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information to a third party without your consent: (a) if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of our Products or Sites, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities; (b) in connection with any legal investigation; (c) when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law, such as when responding to subpoenas, warrants, production orders, or similar orders issued under Canadian laws or by a court of competent jurisdiction served on the Hive Mobile; and/or (d) if we believe in good faith that there is an emergency involving loss of security or serious injury to any person.</p>
<p><strong>4.6</strong> We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate reorganization, a merger or acquisition with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively, “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Policy.</p>
<h5 class="anchor">5. Third Party Websites and Promoted Chats</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> When you click on a link to any other website maintained by anyone other than us, including through your use of the browser feature integrated into Hive Messenger and use of Hive Optimized Pages developed by third parties, you will leave our Site and go to another site and another entity may collect Personal Information or anonymous information from you. Hive Optimized Pages may receive information from your Hive account at your election. Such site’s collection, use and disclosure of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your use of those sites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such sites. Hive Mobile will not be responsible or liable for your use of any such sites and such third party provider’s use, collection, and disclosure of your information. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hive Mobile has no obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve, endorse, or make any representations or warranties with respect to third party sites. You use all third party sites at your own risk. When you access or use third party sites, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before accessing or using any third party sites and Products. This includes making your own assessment about whether “block” or “ignore” features are made available through third party sites.</span></p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> Third party advertisers can create Hive accounts to communicate with Hive users within Hive Messenger (“<strong>Promoted Chats</strong>”). Promoted Chats enable advertisers to send promotional and other messages to any Hive user who has elected to communicate with the advertiser through Hive Messenger. You may unsubscribe from Promoted Chats at any time by following the instructions on Hive Messenger to block messages from the advertiser’s user profile. Hive Mobile does not approve, endorse or make any representations or warranties with respect to Promoted Chats. To track the performance and success of Promoted Chats and to improve the service, Hive may utilize aggregate level tracking of Promoted Chats. For example, Hive may measure how many users who elect to participate in Promoted Chats with a particular advertiser then block messages from that advertiser. Hive may also prepare reports or provide other services to advertisers in respect of their Promoted Chats.</p>
<h5 class="anchor">6. Security</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We store, use, and maintain your Personal Information using procedures designed to limit loss, theft, or unauthorized access, use, modification, copying, or disclosure of your Personal Information. Despite these measures, you should know that the Hive Mobile cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password, and remember to lock your phone when it is not in use.</p>
<h5 class="anchor">7. Choices, Modifications, and Retention</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>

In addition, when you receive newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information in Section 9.1).

When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may retain your anonymous information on our system. We will retain your other Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law or regulation, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you.</p>
<p><strong>7.3</strong> We and other third parties may collect information about you through our Sites and Products, including personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites and applications. While we give you choices described in this Policy, we do not honor Web browser signals and other similar mechanisms that indicate your choice to disable tracking.</p>
