		<h1>PTerms of Use</h1>
<p>Hive Mobile Inc. and its subsidiaries with authorized links to this Agreement (collectively, “<strong>Hive Mobile</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) provide: (a) the website located at <a href="http://numessenger.com">www.numessenger</a>, the Hive Optimized Pages (defined below) provided by us, and/or all other websites of Hive Mobile with authorized links to this Agreement (the “<strong>Sites</strong>”); and (b) any products or services with authorized links to this Agreement, including the Hive Messenger (defined below), In-App Products (defined below), the Hive share button, and the Apps that Hive (defined below) provided by us (collectively, the “<strong>Products</strong>”). These Terms of Service (this “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) set forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Sites and Products.</p>
<p><strong>By using any Site or Product, you are accepting this Agreement and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement. If you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, please do not use any Site or Product. You must be at least 13 years old to use any Site or Product, and if you are 13-18 years old, you may only use a Site or Product if your parent or guardian consents to this Agreement on your behalf. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of you and Hive Mobile with respect to the subject matters hereof (including the Sites and Products) and supersedes and merges all prior discussions and agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matters.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION IN ONTARIO, CANADA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS IN COURT, AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DISPUTES. PLEASE READ <a href="#9.4">SECTION 9.4</a> CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
<h5 class="anchor">1. Overview</h5>
<p class="top"><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="#">(back to top)</a></p>
<p><strong>1.1 Hive Messenger.</strong> Our messenger application (“<strong>Hive Messenger</strong>”) enables users to: (i) send and receive messages and other content between users on their smartphone; (ii) access and search for information and other content available through the World Wide Web; and (iii) access and interact with Hive Optimized Pages (defined below) provided by us or by third parties by allowing Hive Optimized Pages to access your Hive Account (defined below), including your first and last name, Hive username and profile picture (“<strong>User Profile</strong>”).</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Hive Optimized Pages.</strong> Mobile app developers use our application program interface (“<strong>API</strong>”) to create mobile web pages ("<strong>Hive Optimized Pages</strong>") that work within Hive Messenger. Hive Optimized Pages (previously referred to as “Card Features” in earlier versions of this Agreement) may be offered by us or by third parties. Among other features, Hive Optimized Pages may enable users to (i) send links to information or other content (“<strong>Hive Optimized Page Content</strong>”) to other users through Hive Messenger and (ii) share information or data associated with a Hive Account with the third party developer of a Hive Optimized Page. For example, Sketch is a Hive Optimized Page which enables users to send links to sketches (the Hive Optimized Page Content) to other users. When a user receives and opens a link to Hive Optimized Page Content from another Hive user, that link will be automatically added to the user’s browsing history list within Hive Messenger. You may remove links to Hive Optimized Page Content from your browsing history list within Hive Messenger by following the instructions on Hive Messenger.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Apps that Hive.</strong> Hive Messenger integrates with certain applications that users may separately download (“<strong>Apps that Hive</strong>”). Apps that Hive enable users who have installed an application to send the application’s content (“<strong>Apps that Hive Content</strong>”) to other users who have also installed the same application through Hive Messenger. For the avoidance of doubt, you must separately download Apps that Hive in order to use such applications with Hive Messenger. Apps that Hive may be provided by Hive or third parties.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 In-App Purchases.</strong> We may, from time to time, offer certain products or services that users may purchase and use within Hive Messenger (the “<strong>In-App Products</strong>”). For example, you may purchase and use Hive Stickers within Hive Messenger. We reserve the right to revise the pricing for In-App Products at any time without notice to you, and you agree that all sales of In-App Products are final and we are not required to provide a refund for any reason, including termination of this Agreement or your Hive Account, which will result in you being unable to continue to use your purchased In-App Products.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Accounts.</strong> You may browse http://www.numessenger without registering for an account with Hive. In order to use the Products or browse and/or interact with Hive Optimized Pages, you may be required to register for an account with Hive (“<strong>Hive Account</strong>”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (c) your use of the Sites and the Products does not violate any applicable laws. You may terminate your Hive Account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Sites. Hive Mobile may suspend or terminate your Hive Account in accordance with Section 4. <strong>You are solely responsible for selecting an appropriate username and for any and all disclosures you make of your username to others, including any selection or disclosure that makes you personally identifiable.</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Hive Account login username and password (the “<strong>Login Information</strong>”) and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Hive Account. You agree to immediately notify Hive Mobile of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Hive Account, Login Information or any other breach of security. Hive Mobile will have the right, but not the obligation, to deactivate any Hive Account identified in such a notification. Hive Mobile cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
<p><strong>1.6 Invitations.</strong> Hive Messenger allows users to invite other users to join Hive Messenger and to add Hive Optimized Pages or Hive Optimized Page Content (“<strong>Invitations</strong>”). You may only send an Invitation to another user if you have a personal or family relationship with them as defined under applicable Canadian law. Under applicable Canadian law, a personal relationship means that you have had direct, voluntary, two-way communications with the other person, and a reasonable person would conclude that you have a personal relationship taking into consideration relevant factors (i.e. sharing of interests, experiences, opinions and information evidenced in the communications, frequency of communication, whether you have met the other user in person). A “family relationship” means you are related to each other through marriage, common-law partnership, or any legal parent-child relationship in which the individuals have had direct, voluntary, two-way communication.</p>

<p><strong>9.3 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Ontario, Canada for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect our intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.<br />
<a name="9.4"></a><br />
<strong>9.4 Resolution of Disputes.</strong></p>
<p>(a) <em>Mandatory Arbitration.</em> Any dispute or claim between you and Hive Mobile relating to or arising out of the Sites, Products or this Agreement (including disputes about the interpretation of this clause and the arbitrability of the dispute), will be referred to and determined exclusively through binding arbitration conducted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, or such other location as may be determined by the arbitrator, on an individual basis, before a single arbitrator and in accordance with the applicable Ontario arbitration statute (the Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c.17, as amended, or the International Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.9, as amended, or such other statute that may be enacted). However, you and Hive Mobile may take claims to small claims court in Toronto, Ontario, Canada if the dispute qualifies for hearing by such a court. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS, EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. You and Hive Mobile also agree that: (i) you and Hive Mobile will each pay such portion of the costs of the arbitration (which consists of each party’s legal expenses, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, and any other expenses related to the arbitration) as determined by the arbitrator; (ii) the arbitrator may, in making an award regarding the costs of the arbitration, consider whether the costs of the arbitration are cost prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigating in a court, and based on such a finding, require Hive Mobile to pay a greater portion of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, or the travel expenses of you or any witness, than might otherwise be the case, in which case Hive Mobile will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent such cost-prohibitiveness; (iii) Hive Mobile also reserves the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (iv) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (v) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (vi) the arbitrator’s award will be final and non-appealable, but may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

Hive Mobile may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or other operation of law, without your consent. The terms of this Agreement will be binding upon assignees.
